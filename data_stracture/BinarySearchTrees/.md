### WHAT IS A TREE?

A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent / child relationship

### TREE TERMINOLOGY

- Root - The top node in a tree.
- Child -A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root.
- Parent - The converse notion of a child.
- Siblings -A group of nodes with the same parent.
- Leaf - A node with no children.
- Edge - The connection between one node and another.

### HOW Binary Search Trees Work?

- Every parent node has at most two children
- Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent
- Every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent

### Insert method

The idea of insert method is we have a root property and that root property have left value and right value.

- First we add the root value and then check if the root value if smaller than the value then we moved to the left part of the list until there is no left value found.

- Scend we check if the value bigger than we moved the value in right side of the list and loop it until we found an empty or null value

### Big O of Binary Search Trees

Insertion - O(log n)
Searching - O(log n)
