## Given an array of integers, returns indices of the two numbers that add up a given target

**[1,3,7,9,2] 11**

_The valid answer is if we add 9 & 2 we got 11._

### Now think about the solution approach to this problem

- Step 1: Verify the constraints

  **Questions Types**
  _1) Are all the numbers positive or can there be negatives?_
  _2) Are there duplicate numbers in the array?_
  _3) Will there always a solution available?_
  _4) What do we return if there is no solution?_
  _5) Can there be multiple pairs that add up to the target?_

- Step 2: Write some test case
